1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,299
As our world becomes increasingly digitized, so

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,720
does our ability to connect with it.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,410
Imagine if you could search your surroundings the same way you

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,760
search the web.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,840
Using existing cameras and advances in AI,

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,600
we can now find things and people in the real world,

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,324
in real time and take action to improve safety and well-being.

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,460
When a dangerous spill occurs in a chemical plant,

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,330
cameras recognize the incident.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,296
Information about the spill is instantly shared with the people

11
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:36,810
who need it the most.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,090
Enabling them to protect other employees from coming in contact

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,034
with the hazard,

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,910
And clean it up.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,030
This technology can also help keep people safer in hospitals.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,846
Patients recovering from heart surgery are limited to how much

19
00:00:58,846 --> 00:01:00,670
they should exert themselves.

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,652
When someone exceeds the prescribed level of activity,

21
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:04,715
a nurse is alerted.

[MUSIC]

23
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,568
What&#39;s more,

24
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,953
the location of the closest wheelchair is identified, so

25
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:14,415
that the nurse can quickly get the patient seated and safe.

[MUSIC]

27
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,021
This technology is also useful in an environment like

28
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:21,320
a construction site.

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,123
Where people who need specialized tools are spread

30
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:26,480
out, sometimes across multiple floors.

31
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,790
Using cameras already in place,

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,290
this technology can identify a specific tool.

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,410
As well as the closest authorized person who

34
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,820
can deliver it.

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,860
Saving everyone time and keeping the workflow moving.

36
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,292
The digital and physical worlds are come together to help make

37
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:48,950
everyone more safe, secure, and productive.

38
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,662
And we&#39;re bringing the Edge of Microsoft&#39;s Cloud to any device.
